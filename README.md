====================

"Breaking news" effect popup for implementation of growing and twisting block like here: 
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXyE7UD4xXw&feature=youtu.be&t=44s 
Via html css3 and javascript. To be concrete, I'm using css3-transitions and jQuery plugin jquery.transit.js fallbacking to jQuery animate method.

Current version: very raw implementation -- just spent couple of hours.
